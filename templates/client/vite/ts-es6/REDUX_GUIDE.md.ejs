# Redux Toolkit Guide

This project uses Redux Toolkit (RTK) for state management. This guide provides best practices and steps to add new states.

## Store Configuration

The store is configured in `src/store/index.ts`. All reducers should be added to the `reducer` object there.

## Best Practices

1.  **Use Slices**: Put related logic (state, reducers, actions) into slices in `src/store/slices/`.
2.  **Hooks**: Always use the typed hooks `useAppDispatch` and `useAppSelector` from `src/store/hooks.ts` instead of the standard ones from `react-redux`.
3.  **Encapsulation**: Keep state logic in reducers; keep components focused on UI.
4.  **Async Logic**: Use `createAsyncThunk` for API calls within slices.

## How to add a new feature (e.g., Products)

1.  Create `src/store/slices/productSlice.ts`.
2.  Define your state interface and initial status.
3.  Create the slice using `createSlice`.
4.  Export the actions and the reducer.
5.  Register the reducer in `src/store/index.ts`.
6.  Use the state in your components using `useAppSelector(state => state.products)`.
